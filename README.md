# Survey Analysis
NASA Taskload Index (TLX) example survey analysis

<h2> The Need </h2> 
<p>
  During usability test events surveys capture operator workload, situational awareness and feedback. This is an example of the analysis for the raw NASA TLX survey.
</p>
  
<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
  The NASA TLX is a subjective workload assessment survey where users rate their perceived workload while interacting with human-machine interface systems. It has become the industry standard for measuring subjective workload across the Human Systems Integration area of expertise. It is used to assess workload in environments such as command, control, communication and aircraft cockpits. The 'Raw TLX' measure has been utilized for nearly every usability assessment I've been a part of.   It incorporates an overall workload score based on six factors of the subject task: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration.

<h2> Methods </h2>
<p>
  Due to the nature of where test events occur, usually paper copies of the NASA TLX are issued to operators. Researchers then enter the raw data into excel, but perform analyses and data visualizations in Tableau.

<h2> The Benefits </h2>
<p> Performing data analysis and visualization in Tableau has been very beneficial in communicating test event findings to customers, stakeholders and researchers.  The ability to provide complete explanations and visualizations in one dashboard has proven helpful.
